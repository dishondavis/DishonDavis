My name is Dishon Davis, and as a nontraditional Software Engineer, I first started my taking engineering classes, but switched to CS after a year and never looked back. For a few years, coding and programming grew on me, which taught me to have technical knowledge in programming and how to communicate effectively in understanding coding challenges and explaining its solution. I am a team player and patient in dealing with high-stress situations. Now that I've transitioned into a Software Engineer, I hold these traits closely as I work in in the field
